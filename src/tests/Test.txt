For the doorway tests, we chose these cells we did because they are doorways
of different rooms. We chose one doorway that was facing each possible
direction to make sure that they each worked properly.

To ensure that the start and end of the file were read correctly, we chose to test
the very first cell and very last cell of the csv to make sure they were the 
correct room.

To check cells for correct readings, we chose 4 cells across the board that have
different initials.

In order to make sure room centers and labels were being read properly, we
chose to pick 2 different rooms to test that their centers were recorded
correctly. We then chose 2 different rooms and tested that their room labels
were accurate.
